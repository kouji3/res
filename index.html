                    The most basic problem you are going to face when working with responsive images is the aspect ratio or the relationship between width and height. If you shrink the width of an image on smaller screens and do not manipulate the height, the image will appear distorted!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The solution to this issue is incredibly easy, and we’ve already mentioned it in an earlier lesson: don’t define both a width and a height. If an image is given a flexible width, and the height is set to auto, then it should retain its aspect ratio correctly.

                    <span class="span">background-position</span> and <span class="span">background-size</span> are properties that work on elements with a background image, and do not work on normal img tags. You’ll see some examples and specifics in the reading assignment later, but you can get quite a lot of control over the display and placement of background images by working with these properties. For example, background-position: center will make sure the image is always centered in its container, even if the container is too small to fit the whole image. background-size: cover will resize the image so that it is always completely filling its container while cropping as little as possible.
